      <h2>Warranty Information</h2>

<p>All of our repair services come with a 90 day warranty on parts and labor. Accidental or external damages will void all warranty claims. We do not issue refunds for repair services.</p>

<p>Shipping costs to us are taken care of by the customer (both ways if your iPod is outside of warranty). No returns will be accepted without a valid Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA).</p>

<p>To request and RMA contact customer service at <a href="tel:866-929-3767">866.929.DROP</a> 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. est.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>How do I use The Pod Drop Service ?</h3>

<p>Fill out our online service request form. You can automatically generate a United States Postal Service (USPS) shipping label. Just package your iPod with the shipping label and drop it off at any USPS location, or give to your mail carrier.</p>

<h3>What do I send?</h3>
<p>Only ship the iPod itself. However, if you are experiencing a charging problem or a problem that you think is related to another item, please include it in the package.</p>

<h3>Then What Happens?</h3>
<p>In most cases, an authorized Pod Drop Network technician will contact you within 24 hours of receiving your product. Our technician will discuss the diagnosis and solution options in order to satisfy your service request. Most repairs can be performed within 48 hours (normal business days).</p>


<h3>How much is this going to cost me?</h3>
<p>Our repair services are competitively priced but we cannot fairly quote you a price until a technician of the Pod Drop network examines your defective unit.</p>

<h3>Accepting or Declining our Service.</h3>

<p>ACCEPT - Acceptance through verbal communications by means of telephone constitutes a legal binding agreement whereas payment for repairs or modifications is now required. At this time you will be required to supply us with a secure form of payment (CREDIT CARD or PAYPAL only) for our services.</p>
<p>DECLINE - If, for some reason, you decline our services, we MAY offer to purchase your defective product from you at an agreed upon price. Otherwise you will be subject to a $29.00 service fee to cover professional tech diagnosis and return shipping fees.</p>
<p>IN EITHER CASE, once you have been contracted by The Pod Drop network, you will be granted a 90 day window to either accept or decline our services. Merchandise left at our facility longer than 90 days will be deemed abandoned and automatically recycled. Please remember that recycled merchandise CANNOT be sent back to you!</p>

<h3>Should I back up my music & files prior to packaging?</h3>
<p>If possible it is always a good idea to back up any media that has the potential of being lost in the repair process. The Pod Drop will make every effort to retain your data, but in the event that such material is lost, Pod Drop assumes NO responsibility. PLEASE back up your files.</p>
